# 🤖 Object Following Robot

## 📌 Overview
The **Object Following Robot** is an intelligent robotic system designed to detect and follow a human or object using a combination of **ultrasonic** and **IR sensors**. It automates movement based on proximity sensing and is ideal for applications in **medical assistance**, **shopping**, and **military support**.

## 💡 Features
- Follows a person or object within ~4 meters
- Avoids obstacles using ultrasonic detection
- Uses IR for lateral object tracking
- Controlled by Arduino and motor driver

## 🛠️ Working Principle

- **Ultrasonic sensor** detects distance and adjusts movement forward or backward.
- **IR sensors** detect lateral displacement and guide left or right turns.
- **Servo motor** can help rotate ultrasonic sensor for wider detection.
- All components are controlled via Arduino UNO using PWM and digital I/O pins.
